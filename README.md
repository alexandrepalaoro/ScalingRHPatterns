# ScalingRHPatterns

Excel model and R-code for the paper entitled "Weaponry and defenses in fighting animals: How allometry can alter predictions from contest theory" authored by Alexandre V. Palaoro and Mark Briffa that is published on Behavioral Ecology: <br/>

<i>Palaoro, AV & Briffa, M (2017) Weaponry and defenses in fighting animals: How allometry can alter predictions from contest theory. Behavioral Ecology, 28: 328-336. DOI: 10.1093/beheco/arw163<br/></i>

In the excel file you will find an interactive sheet where you can change the parameters of the model freely (and the body size values for the animals). In the R-code you will find the same functionality.<br/>
